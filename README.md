# MobyTest

This repo will be used in future as an end-to-end test using infraKit, linuxKit and swarmKit.

# Disclaimer

Although I'm a #DockerCaptain this stuff is new to me. With that in mind I'm playing about with the new moby tooling.

# First attempt

Followed the steps [here](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit) and installed moby locally.  Using the JenkinsOS.yml created a bootable .iso which ran an alpine based Jenkins container.

## Commands
```
moby build configs/JenkinsOS.yml
moby run JenkinsOS

```

## Pros

Fairly straight forward

Fails fast if you are missing any dependencies

## Cons

Had to install a bunch of stuff locally like go, make, qemu etc

# Second attempt

Thought it would be even cooler to use Docker in Docker to run the moby tool, therefore avoiding messing with my host.

## Commands

Update the `OS_CONFIG` environment var to build a different image

For example to build the bundled `JenkinsOS.yml` image

```
docker build -t mobytest .
docker run -it --rm --privileged -e OS_CONFIG=JenkinsOS.yml -v ${PWD}/images:/images -v ${PWD}/configs:/configs mobytest
```

When the commands complete you should have 4 images stored in ${PWD}/images.
```
tom-laptop:/scratch/MobyTest# ls images
JenkinsOS-efi.iso  JenkinsOS-initrd.img  JenkinsOS.iso  JenkinsOS.vmdk
```

## Testing the images are working

### Option 1

You can use VirtualBox or qemu on your host to verify the images are bootable.

### Option 2

There is a handy script in the [linuxkit/scripts](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/tree/master/scripts) directory to boot the iso using qemu in a container.

Here are the manual steps. The QEMU_IMAGE will likely change :
```
QEMU_IMAGE=linuxkit/qemu:4563d58e97958f4941fbef9e74cabc08bd402144@sha256:b2db0b13ba1cbb6b48218f088fe0a4d860e1db2c4c6381b5416536f48a612230
FILE=/scratch/MobyTest/images/JenkinsOS.iso
BASE=$(basename "$FILE")
MOUNTS="-v $FILE:/tmp/$BASE"
DEVKVM="--device=/dev/kvm"

docker run -it --rm $MOUNTS $DEVKVM "$QEMU_IMAGE"

```

### Option 3

Use the same container image that we built earlier "mobytest:jenkins" to test the image is bootable.

```
This next command may look a little magical but all it's doing is forwarding port 8080 from the container running in the VM through qemu to the container running on your host.  Jenkins will be available on your localhost:8080

docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash --name test_image --privileged -v ${PWD}/images:/images -p 0.0.0.0:8080:8080 mobytest:jenkins -c "qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1024 -net user,hostfwd=tcp::8080-:8080 -net nic -localtime -smp 2 -k en-us -hda /images/JenkinsOS.qcow2 -nographic"


```

When the VM has booted you'll see something like : 
```
Welcome to LinuxKit

                        ##         .
                  ## ## ##        ==
               ## ## ## ## ##    ===
           /"""""""""""""""""\___/ ===
      ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~
           \______ o           __/
             \    \         __/
              \____\_______/

```

So far so good. What now?

### Runc

Check which containers are running :
```
runc list

ID          PID         STATUS      BUNDLE                         CREATED                          OWNER
dhcpcd      693         running     /containers/services/dhcpcd    2017-04-22T00:25:00.450608657Z   root
jenkins     715         running     /containers/services/jenkins   2017-04-22T00:25:00.458477205Z   root
ntpd        729         running     /containers/services/ntpd      2017-04-22T00:25:00.815188054Z   root
```

We can see our Jenkins container, defined [here](JenkinsOS.yml) is running.

What is running in the Jenkins container?
```
runc ps jenkins

PID   USER     TIME   COMMAND
  624 root       0:00 /bin/tini -- /usr/local/bin/jenkins.sh
  668 root       3:03 java -jar /usr/share/jenkins/jenkins.war
```

### Services and Filesystem

What is inside /containers/services/jenkins?
```
/containers/services/jenkins # ls
config.json  rootfs

```

The initialAdminPassword for Jenkins is located in : /containers/services/jenkins/rootfs/var/jenkins_home/secrets

The config.json is read-only and contains the metadata for the container service.
The rootfs contains the usual directories of a linux subsystem and our jenkins_home is in rootfs/var/jenkins_home.

Try updating the OS :

```
apk update
ERROR: Unable to lock database: Read-only file system
ERROR: Failed to open apk database: Read-only file system
```

Wait what?

This is by design.  

"LinuxKit has a read-only root filesystem: system configuration and sensitive files cannot be modified after boot. The only files on LinuxKit that are allowed to be modified pertain to namespaced container data and stateful partitions."

This will help encourage the re-building rather than the modification of the base OS. 
 
# Summary

That's as far as I got. Hope it helps some folks get up and running faster. This is a nice way to use the commands we already know and try out linuxKit without installing tooling locally.
